# Vite + React Project

This is a simple starter template for creating a React project using Vite as the build tool.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:realokd/thence_assignment.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd thence_assignment
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the development server:**
